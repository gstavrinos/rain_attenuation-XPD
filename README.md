## Disclaimer(s) :warning:

1. Keep in mind that the script uses the ITU Recommendations included in the ITU-R folder.
This does not mean that the latest ITU-R is being used. For example, The very first (!)
P.837 is used, to simplify region selection.

2. All of the values are hardcoded based on the input provided by our instructor during the course.
Despite the static nature of the exercise though, the script has been developed in a way to easily
generalize for almost all possible values. There are comments in places that assumptions based on the course
input have been made, to help future users identify them easily.
